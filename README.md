# Getting Started with Create React App

- The UI contains a search box to let users search for a keyword. When the user presses the search button, the UI should display a maximum of 25 tweets at a time using the Twitter streaming API
- The UI also contains a notification icon (at the top) to inform users of the count of newly arrived tweets matching the keyword i.e., as new tweets arrive matching the keyword, the user should be notified of the count in real-time via the notification icon
- In addition, implement a "Load More" functionality to allow users to view new unread tweets in an event driven fashion (look at Twitter search interface for inspiration). As soon as the user clicks on "Load More" the user should see the newly arrived batch of tweets in the UI
- Implemented The functionality to like the Posts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
